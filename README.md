# edps-845

This repository contains resources for R programming, and serves as a sandbox for students learning R in the UNL course EDPS 845, taught summer 2017.

## Informal prerequisites

* Doctoral level course in statistical methods (intro stat methods, regression, ANOVA)
* General familiarity with programming (variables, objects, methods, conditionals)
* Some exposure to R (downloaded, installed, tried it out, know what it's for)

## Objectives of the course

EDPS 845 presents a broad overview of R, including its applications in simulating, manipulating, analyzing, modeling, and graphing data. Functional programming and R package development will also be addressed for students needing to fulfill research tool degree requirements.

Course objectives include learning how to:

1. Navigate the basic features of R and RStudio
2. Import and export data
3. Manipulate and prepare data for analysis
4. Analyze data and fit statistical models
5. Visualize data and results

QQPM students and those interested in advanced R will also learn to:

6. Modify existing R functionality
7. Write and document R functions
8. Use git to contribute to an existing R package

## Materials for the course

* R, available at [cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)
* RStudio, IDE for R, available at [www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/)
